# Sarvric: AI-Powered Rust Smart Contract Platform

**Sarvric** is an AI-powered platform for building, editing, deploying, and interacting with Rust-based smart contracts on Solana using Anchor. It aims to simplify the entire smart contract workflow, from AI-assisted contract generation to client SDK creation and frontend integration.

---

## **Core Features**

### **1. AI Contract Generation**

- Generate Rust-based Anchor contracts from natural language descriptions.
- Use pre-built templates for common Solana programs:
  - Token contracts
  - NFT contracts
  - DeFi programs
  - Escrow or payment programs
- Option to generate modular contracts with separate instructions, accounts, and error enums.

### **2. Smart Contract Editor**

- Rich code editor with Rust syntax highlighting (Monaco/CodeMirror).
- Live preview of contract structure: instructions, accounts, events.
- Refactoring tools:
  - Rename instructions
  - Restructure accounts
- Highlight mismatches between contract code and Anchor conventions.

### **3. IDL & Metadata Generation**

- Auto-generate IDL for the contract.
- Generate deployment artifacts like `Cargo.toml`, build scripts, and client SDKs.

---

## **AI-Powered Enhancements**

### **1. Contract Assistor**

- Suggest improvements to contract logic.
- Optimize instructions and reduce contract size.
- Detect redundant or unsafe logic.
- Generate documentation and comments inline.
- Suggest type-safe account layouts and commonly used structs.
- Warn about known vulnerabilities (unchecked seeds, missing payer checks, etc.).

### **2. Summarization & Explanation**

- Human-readable summaries for instructions, account requirements, and errors.
- Security considerations explained in plain English.

### **3. Feature Suggestions**

- AI suggests additional instructions or functionalities based on contract type.
- Boilerplate for admin functionality, royalties, or access control.

## **Developer Utilities**

- **Version Control**
  - Auto-save versions and rollback capabilities.
- **Testing & Simulation**
  - Auto-generate Anchor test scripts.
  - Simulate transactions in-browser or on devnet.
- **Contract Visualization**
  - Graphical representation of instructions, accounts, and relationships.

- **Code Snippets**
  - Predefined modular snippets (e.g., PDA creation, token minting, escrow logic).

---

## **Deployment & Post-Deployment Features**

- **One-Click Deployment**
  - Deploy to Solana Devnet, Testnet, or Mainnet.
  - Auto-generate CLI commands for deployment.
- **ID/Address Management**
  - Track deployed program IDs.
  - Generate client SDKs to interact with deployed contracts.

- **Monitoring & Analytics**
  - Display usage stats: calls per instruction, errors, deprecated patterns.

---

## **Client Generation & Integration**

- **AI-Powered Client SDK**
  - Automatically generate TypeScript/JavaScript client.
  - Functions for each instruction with typed inputs/outputs.
  - Pre-configured Anchor Provider and wallet integration.
  - Helper functions for PDAs, token minting, and transactions.

- **Frontend Boilerplate**
  - React/Next.js starter project prewired with wallet adapters.
  - Hooks for each contract instruction.
  - Example UI components (forms, buttons) linked to instructions.

- **Integration AI Assist**
  - Suggest UI patterns based on contract type:
    - NFT → gallery + mint button
    - Token → transfer + balance display
    - DeFi → swap/exchange interface
  - Auto-generate ID to UI mapping for account balances, token states, etc.

- **Testing & Simulation**
  - Generate frontend integration tests.
  - Simulate transactions in-browser for UX validation.

- **Deployment + Client Bundling**
  - Deploy contract and generate client SDK for immediate use.
  - Instructions for integrating SDK into other projects.

---

## **Optional “Lovable” Features**

- **Interactive AI Chat**
  - Ask questions about contracts: e.g., “Which accounts are required?” or “How to implement royalties?”
- **Collaboration**
  - Share contracts with other developers for co-editing and review.
- **Template Marketplace**
  - Community-curated or official contract templates ready to customize.

- **Security Checklist**
  - AI-powered checklist: seeds, admin restrictions, rent exemption checks.

- **Export Options**
  - Export contract + IDL + tests + deployment scripts as a complete package.

- **Interactive Sandbox**
  - Test contract interactions through a generated client without writing frontend code.

## **Workflow Overview**

1. **Generate Contract** → AI creates Anchor contract from specification.
2. **Edit & Improve** → Rich editor with AI suggestions and refactoring.
3. **Generate IDL & Client** → Auto-generate IDL and client SDK.
4. **Deploy** → One-click deployment to Solana network.
5. **Integrate & Test** → Use generated frontend boilerplate and simulate transactions.
6. **Monitor & Iterate** → Track usage stats, errors, and receive AI improvement suggestions.
